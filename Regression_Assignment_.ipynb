The intercept provides a baseline or starting value for the dependent variable when there is no contribution from the independent variable. For example, in a real-world scenario like predicting monthly electricity costs based on air conditioner usage, the intercept would represent the fixed cost you pay even if the air conditioner isn't used at all. It’s an important component of the model as it allows the regression line to adjust vertically to best fit the data.\n"
